## **What is SOSial?**
**SOSial** is a service designed to assist people communicate and receive critical information before and during times of emergencies as well as disaster.

The main differentiating factor about **SOSial** is that it is designed to work even **without cellular network** and **internet services** which are often unavailable during natural disasters. 

## **What do we plan to build and how does it work?**
The main focus of SOSial is the **SOSial app** which enables people to communicate and connect to each other using **Wifi Direct** technology which does not require any sort of cellular network or internet. People will be able to communicate with their family and friends miles away using this technology.

Our service will also be available for people with feature phones to get updates about their families and friends as well as critical information needed during disasters.
Our entire infrastructure is managed at the backend by our server, which will constantly analyze national agencies like Meterological Department for updates
on the disaster. It will also analyze news feeds and social trends to help figure out and convey to people about impending disasters using Machine Learning and Predictive algorithms.

We also plan to build a website that will enable people to get updates about their loved ones stuck in these calamities and provide monetary support or volunteer.
The app and the server will work in sync and make sure everyone is updated about what's happening and provide them helpful information to help them endure during these difficult times.

## **How users can get started with the project?**
The services available for users would be our SOSial app in which people will have to pair with mobile phones of their relatives or whomsoever they want to contact during the disaster. This will be without cellular networks. If cellular network is available, new users can also connect. The website will also enable people to find out info about friends and family members and also support them by monetary support or by volunteering.
